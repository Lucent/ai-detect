# Visualize AI segments of text using Pangram

A Python tool for visualizing AI-generated by parts in text files using the Pangram API.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Requires a `.env` file with Pangram API credentials. Currently 5 cents per 1000 words.

## Commands

### python check.py <path/file.txt>
Main script for analyzing text files to detect AI-generated content. Takes a file path as input, checks the Pangram API for AI detection results, and displays a colorized visualization showing the likelihood of AI assistance for different segments of the text. Results are cached in `cache.tsv` to avoid redundant API calls.

### python view_cache.py
Utility script for viewing cached AI detection results. Reads the `cache.tsv` file and displays a timeline of all analyzed files with their segment visualization bars. Use to see how scores evolve over time with editing.

### python view_latest.py
Shows the most recent cached result for each file with summary and segment bars.

### python batch_check.py
Processes a Substack export by converting HTML posts to plaintext via pandoc and running check.py on each.

### python analyze_bounds.py
Analyzes cache.tsv to show classification boundaries and confidence ranges by label.

 | Classification         | Range    |
 |------------------------|----------|
 | Human Written          | 0  -  47 |
 | Lightly AI-Assisted    | 21 -  60 |
 | AI-Generated           | 49 - 100 |
