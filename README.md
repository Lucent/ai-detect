## Installation

```
Requires a `.env` file with Pangram API credentials. Currently 5 cents per 1000 words.

## Commands

### python check.py <path/file.txt>
Main script for analyzing text files to detect AI-generated content. Takes a file path as input, checks the Pangram API for AI detection results, and displays a colorized visualization showing the likelihood of AI assistance for different segments of the text. Results are cached in `cache.tsv` to avoid redundant API calls.

### python view_cache.py
Utility script for viewing cached AI detection results. Reads the `cache.tsv` file and displays a timeline of all analyzed files with their segment visualization bars. Use to see how scores evolve over time with editing.
